This repository implements Spectral Collocation Method for pricing American options and runs numerical tests to analyse the results in terms of accuracy, numerical stability and convergence speed for the difference choices of model parameters $l$, $m$, $n$ and spot price $S$, interest rate $r$, dividend $q$ and time to maturity $\tau$.
